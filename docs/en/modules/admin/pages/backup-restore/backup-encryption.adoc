= Backup encryption in MinIO (SSE-KMS)

To mitigate the risk of exposing unencrypted backup data in case of unauthorized access, the Platform implements server-side encryption (SSE-KMS).
This mechanism ensures that all stored objects are encrypted at rest, without requiring any changes in how users or services interact with MinIO.

This document outlines how SSE-KMS encryption works in the Platform's MinIO environment, which relies on integration with KES Server and Platform Vault.

== What is SSE-KMS and how does it work?

*Server-Side Encryption with KMS (SSE-KMS)* enables automatic encryption of files on the server side before they are written to disk. Encryption happens *in flight*—as each object is uploaded to MinIO. When the object is retrieved, it is automatically decrypted. From the user's perspective, everything works the same way as before.

- All data is stored in encrypted form on disk.
- Encryption keys are securely stored in Vault.

[NOTE]
====
SSE-KMS does not replace full disk encryption (FS-level encryption); it complements it by encrypting objects at the application layer within MinIO. For optimal protection, both layers should be used together.

== Backup encryption diagram

The diagram below shows a high-level view of how the components interact to encrypt backup data.

.Component integration: MinIO, KES Server, and Vault

- *MinIO* — Object storage that holds backup data.
- *KES Server* — A service or agent that acts as a KMS proxy for MinIO and a client to Vault.
- *Vault* — A secret management system that stores encryption keys.

How the components interact ::

. *KES Server* authenticates to *Vault* using the `AppRole` method with a `role_id` and `secret_id`.
. *Vault* returns a temporary token (`Vault Token`).
. Using this token, *KES Server* either retrieves or creates the encryption key (if not already present).
. *MinIO* sends encryption/decryption requests to *KES Server*, which acts as a proxy to Vault-stored keys.

[NOTE]
====
*KES Server* is not a backend system in itself. It runs as a local service alongside MinIO. It receives encryption-related requests from MinIO and independently communicates with Vault to fulfill them.
